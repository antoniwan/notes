# Notes

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-5.19.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/antoniwan/notes/releases)

Personal writing site: essays and notes on fatherhood, masculinity, culture, and day-to-day life. Some posts are in English, some in Spanish, with links between translations where it applies.

Live site: [notes.antoniwan.online](https://notes.antoniwan.online)

## What it includes

- Posts in `src/content/p/` (Markdown and MDX); the file count grows over time
- **10 categories** (for example Parenting, Psychology, Politics, Metaspace) — see `src/data/categories.ts`
- **Dark and light theme**, including system preference
- **Layout** that works on phones and larger screens
- **Search** in the header (built from a client-side index at build time)
- **Guided Path** — seasonal reading order; progress stays in the browser only
- **Everything** — full archive-style list
- **Tags** — browse by tag; **Tag management** page for analytics-style views
- **Tag prelude links** — `/tag` now shows a sentence-style list of canonical writing-form links (for example essays, notes, poems) above the tag cloud when available
- **Brain Science** — several pages of writing stats and charts (cadence, topics, sentiment, and similar)
- **Book library** — static reference data under `/library` and `/library/books`
- **Reading time** — added at build time by a remark plugin (`minutesRead` in the collection)
- **Reading progress** on posts — stored in `localStorage` only, not on a server
- **Table of contents on long posts** — floating "Contents" button with section links and a quick "Top" jump
- **RSS** (`/rss.xml`) and **JSON Feed** (`/feed.json`)
- **Random quotes API** — `GET /api/quotes` (Stoic quotes from local data)
- **Public API** page at `/api/` — human-readable overview of endpoints
- **Schema.org JSON-LD** on pages where it fits
- **Comments** — [Remark42](https://remark42.com/) embed when you configure a host (optional; see `docs/comments-setup.md`)
- **Service worker** — registered for caching; version bumps during `pnpm run build`
- On **Vercel**: **Web Analytics** and **Speed Insights** components are included in the base layout (they only send data when the site runs on Vercel with those products enabled)

## Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) 6 — static output, MDX, `@astrojs/vercel` adapter
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Sharp for image work in the build

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antoniwan/notes.git
cd notes
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:4321`.

This repo expects **pnpm**; you can use npm or yarn if you change commands yourself.

## Environment variables (optional)

For production builds of the **About** page, Letterboxd “latest watched” needs RSS URLs. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set:

- `LETTERBOXD_PROFILE_URL`
- `LETTERBOXD_RSS_URL`

If they are missing, that block on About simply won’t have fresh data (or may be empty depending on fallbacks).

Remark42 uses `PUBLIC_REMARK42_HOST` and `PUBLIC_REMARK42_SITE_ID` when you turn comments on — see `docs/comments-setup.md`.

Feature-specific components live under `src/components/<feature>/` when they are only used by matching routes. Shared pieces sit at the top level of `src/components/`.

## Content

Post frontmatter is documented in [docs/frontmatter-spec.md](docs/frontmatter-spec.md).

Translations: same `translationGroup` on each language version; use `featured` so only one version shows in main lists. Details: [docs/multilingual-setup.md](docs/multilingual-setup.md).

Using Cursor AI in this repo: [docs/cursor-agent-skills.md](docs/cursor-agent-skills.md).

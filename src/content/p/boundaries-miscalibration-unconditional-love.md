This is a record of mistakes I made, why I made them, and how I recalibrated. I am not trying to excuse myself. I want to be accurate and useful. If this helps someone avoid the same errors, it is worth it.

## 1. What I Did

I set boundaries during a high-stress season. The boundaries were needed. The way I enforced them was not.

I used too much emotional force. Not physical force, but final words, heat, and a scorched-earth tone. That caused damage I did not need to cause.

I chose speed over calibration. I ended things fast, shut down nuance, and acted like urgency was the only safe option. Some of that was necessary. Some of it was not.

Short term, things felt better. Long term, the collateral damage showed up.

## 2. Why I Did It

Two drivers were at play.

**Threat compression.** Under pressure, I collapsed nuance in favor of safety. When your nervous system is overloaded, “end it now” feels safer than “hold complexity.”

**Boundary conflation.** I treated boundaries and emotional force as the same thing. They are not. A boundary is a limit. Force is a delivery style. I confused necessity with intensity.

I was protecting myself with the tools I had. Those tools were shaped by fatigue, prior harm, and limited bandwidth. That explains my behavior. It does not erase the harm.

## 3. The Faulty Frame I Used

After the fact, I briefly believed this:

> **If I were a better parent, a better person, this would not have happened this way.**

That sounds honest, but it is inaccurate. It reduces a complex outcome to a single cause so I can keep a sense of control. That trades truth for a neat story.

A more accurate statement is:

> **I made specific mistakes, in specific seasons, under specific constraints, and those mistakes mattered.**

Precision matters because vague guilt blocks integration.

## 4. The Reframe That Helped

The reframe was not self-forgiveness. It was about clearer definitions. I separated:

- **Boundaries** from **heat**
- **Intent** from **impact**
- **Capacity then** from **ideal behavior in hindsight**

That led to a simple sentence with no excuses:

> **I protected myself, and I caused damage I regret.**

That sentence holds under pressure. It is accurate.

## 5. Parenting as a Live Test

I saw this clearly in parenting.

When my five-year-old showed dysregulation, I repeated simple lines:

- There are things I don’t like, but I always like you.
- My love is not a reward or a punishment.

The result was immediate softening.

Children do not test limits to defy authority. They test to verify attachment. When limits feel paired with abandonment, escalation follows. When limits are paired with steady presence, regulation follows.

My earlier mistake was mixing limits with abandonment signals.

## 6. What I Would Tell Others

If you are setting boundaries:

- Do not assume force equals effectiveness.
- Ask yourself if you are enforcing a limit or discharging heat.

If you are feeling global guilt:

- Replace vague self-sentencing with specific inventory.
- Evidence matters. If you do not have evidence, it may be noise.
- Precision reduces distortion.

Love is not conditional. We should show care right after limits. We can set boundaries and still treat people with love.

## 7. Integration Check

I do not need to punish myself to admit harm. I do not need to rewrite history to live with it.

The lesson is not “be softer” or “be harder.” It is “be precise,” and pair precision with love and care.

Most damage does not come from values themselves. It comes from misapplying them under load.

Good luck.

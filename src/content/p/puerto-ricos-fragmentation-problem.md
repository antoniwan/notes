# Puerto Rico's Fragmentation Problem

> Humor lowers defenses. But don't get confused. If something here tightens your stomach or pisses you off a little, good. That reaction is data. Trust it. I'm not asking you to agree with me. I'm asking you to *notice*.

Puerto Rico operates like a high school where the cliques don't just decide who sits where. They decide who gets access, who gets extracted, and who gets buried when the infrastructure fails.

Before we name the cliques, we need to be clear about the baseline.

My parents live here. My ex-wife lives here. My parent's family lives here. My daughter lives here. My sister lives here. So when I talk about Puerto Rico's economic reality, this isn't academic. I watch this system grind people I love in real time. And if you're reading this from the island you probably know worse situations and cases than I do.

Puerto Rico's median household income is **$25,096**. The U.S. mainland sits at **$78,538**. This means that about **~43% of Puerto Rico residents live in poverty**, the highest rate of any U.S. jurisdiction. Mississippi, the poorest state, is under 20%.

Electricity costs **34 cents per kWh**. Mainland average is about **14 cents**. That's nearly **2.5× the price** for a grid that has collapsed repeatedly under private management (*Hey Luma!*).

Tolls increased again January 1st, 2026, with hikes across PR-22, PR-52, PR-5, PR-20, PR-53, PR-66 and the Puente Teodoro Moscoso (Metro Puerto Rico, 2026). Traveling round-trip on the José de Diego highway from San Juan to Hatillo now costs $13.60, up from $12.40 (Primera Hora, 2025).

The percent of debt to personal income is almost 90%—a ratio where anything above 50% indicates financial distress (Consolidated Credit, 2025). Six out of ten people who seek financial advisory services express feeling overwhelmed by debt. "People are no longer able to make ends meet, and they're using credit cards as part of their income to maintain certain levels of consumption" (Washington Journal Puerto Rico, 2025).

And healthcare isn't just becoming unaffordable—the doctors are leaving. Puerto Rico loses nearly **400 physicians annually** to the mainland, where family doctors earn an average of $237,000 compared to $194,307 on the island (JAMA Health Forum, 2024). Between 2010 and 2012, more than 4,000 health professionals—approximately 9% of the healthcare workforce—migrated to the U.S. mainland (Urban Institute, 2021). The ones who stay face longer wait times, reduced services, and the same exhaustion that keeps everyone else from engaging politically.

So yeah—jump on the Tacoma, post the beach pic, and let's talk archetypes.

## The Salaried Professionals

If you're a salaried professional in Puerto Rico, you are almost certainly underpaid to the point that political engagement becomes inherited instead of examined. The old **voto íntegro** system made this easy. In 2012, the PNP pulled 47% of its votes straight-ticket. The PPD got 46%. That's **93% of voters marking one X** under their family's color. Straight-ticket voting was the default for over 96% of voters.

Here's a concrete example from one of the hardest working women I've ever met: A Director of Sales at the largest cornmeal manufacturer on the island—a billion-dollar company, by the way—making **under $70k**. I have stories like this, professionals of all sorts, in all verticals, and it's mostly the same story.

Executive responsibility with entry-level mainland pay.

If you live here, you *know* this isn't rare. You know *exactly* who and what I'm talking about.

Y'all work 50+ hour weeks and commute through toll roads that cost $35–40 a month minimum.  Then, again, pay double the mainland electricity rate.

By the time election season comes around, they're cooked because exhaustion isn't a side effect. It's the mechanism that foments they mark one X. Go home. Keep the machine moving because they don't have the energy to fight the machine. Rajamos la papeleta! Yay!

By the way, about **22% of these households pay credit card late fees**. These aren't irresponsible people. These are professionals drowning inside a cost structure designed to bleed them slowly.

 > I was one of these, but the colonized in me was too strong, so I left to chase money in the mainland.


## The Welfare Class

This group is exploited for votes and federal assistance dollars, often without full visibility into how the extraction works. The finesse in these matters, this is where our politicians spend all their energy, not on actual meaningful work, in PR (public relations) and the welfare class eats that shit up like sandwichitos de mezcla.

1.4 million people in Puerto Rico live below the federal poverty line. Almost one-in-five reports foregoing medical treatment because of cost (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2023).

**They live genuinely hard lives.** IMHO, these people live in HARD-MODE difficulty.

Consumer culture becomes the only accessible form of agency when you are surviving like this, by the way. Jordans. Cash for *verse cabrón*. A moment of dignity. I get it.

The cruelty isn't how they spend. 
The cruelty is that consumption is the *only* dignity the system offers while stripping healthcare, education, and mobility. At least our people are housed, right? I haven't researched this one but... I don't even want to look.

When the power goes out, these are the people who die first.

Seven years after María, Puerto Rico still doesn't have an integrated system to identify people who depend on electricity to survive.

> I'm not qualified to speak *for* this group.  
> My father grew up in poverty as an orphan in Santurce but I didn't.  
> What I know is secondhand. What I *do* know is that they are the most exploited and the most disposable when infrastructure fails. Their story deserves a first-person voice.

## The Affluent (Los Apellidos)

Inherited wealth, recognizable surnames, political dynasties. Possibly not qualified... Many run for office. Many steal. Corruption is endemic in Puerto Rican politics—a parade of indictments across administrations confirms what everyone already knows (Refworld, 2012). But communism... But Cuba...

Their kids leave for the mainland. The island they "own" is collapsing around them. They need generators, private water systems, private security. They perform status ("los más duros") while the dissonance between image and reality requires constant anesthesia.

Corruption in Puerto Rico isn't episodic—it's ambient. A steady parade of indictments across administrations confirms what everyone already knows.

They want a Puerto Rico without Puerto Ricans.

They vacation in Spain.  
Send their kids to U.S. colleges.  
Invest in mainland real estate.

What kind of self-respect is that? I personally don't know. IMHO, they don't respect the island. They respect money. They don't respect you or me. 

Deep down, they know the whole thing is rotting.  
No amount of rum, coke, cocaine, or club memberships fixes that.
Possibly is not fluent in English... by the way...

## The Religious Bloc

The congregation that votes as instructed. 

Proyecto Dignidad, for example, doesn't need a massive vote share to matter. They have something more efficient: **church networks**. The pastor points and the flock marks the ballot. Jesuschrist would fuck with this?

They vote against their own interests, then wonder why the hospitals don't work.

"These people are very well organized and have always had a profound political impact. The PNP and PPD right-wing politicians care a lot about the opinion of the religious sectors because they move many people, a lot of votes" (International Women's Media Foundation, n.d.).

After María, the most common causes of death weren't storm injuries. They were **cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney failure**—conditions that become lethal when care disappears.

People tithe money they don't have to churches that tell them how to vote for politicians who gut healthcare.

Then they pray. And then they die from preventable conditions. Pero ganamos...

## **Los Más Cool (yo les digo Los Más Pendejos)**

Young. Educated. Online.

Hyper-aware of Venezuela and Cuba—or at least they think they are. Extremely opinionated about Israel and Palestine. Deeply invested in U.S. politics, or at minimum deeply invested in having opinions about it. Many of them consume their politics the same way they consume Netflix: endlessly, passively, as background noise that produces the illusion of engagement.

But these people have never voted in a Puerto Rican election.

"They all suck."  
"It doesn't matter."  
"They're all corrupt."  
"What's the point?"

They live under the same collapsing infrastructure as everyone else. They pay the same 34 cents per kilowatt-hour. They sit through the same blackouts. They drive the same toll roads. They deal with the same unreliable healthcare system. None of that is abstract to them. It's their daily life.

And yet they have convinced themselves that non-participation is a form of protest rather than permission. Every election they skip is a vote for continuity. Not symbolically. Literally. Compliance without the dignity of neither knowing or admitting it.

## The Conscious Ones (Los Pelús)

The people who understand imperial law, historical patterns, colonial economics. Marginalized *precisely* because their analysis threatens the bipartisan machinery. They build their own infrastructure out of necessity. These are the professors, philosophers, community leaders, los Tito Kayak, las Lola Rodriguez de Tio, these are our real leaders, the community.

They see everything clearly and can change almost nothing except their own environment, around them. Y cuidao', porque la policia no protege a la comunidad, protege el capital.

They're called communists, told to go to Venezuela, dismissed as idealists. They watch the same disasters repeat while their neighbors vote for the same two parties. They organize, they educate, they build solar microgrids and community health clinics, and they watch the elections get stolen anyway.

But there's movement. There's hope.

The straight-ticket vote dropped from 47%/46% in 2012 to 29%/25% by 2020 (Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, 2024a). The Alianza (PIP/MVC) explicitly rejects voto íntegro. In the 2024 general election, the Alianza secured second place with approximately 33% of the vote—a historic result (Grokipedia, 2025b).

The "corazón del rollo" is bleeding out. The question is whether the erosion translates to actual power transfer before the next 3,000 people die from infrastructure failure.

## The Body Count Doesn't Care About Your Clique

Hurricane María killed roughly 3,000 people, not because of wind speed, but because the healthcare system collapsed and electricity stayed out for months. Six days after landfall, only 18 of 69 hospitals were functioning in any capacity. Every resident lost power. In rural municipalities, the blackout lasted more than half a year.

This did not end with María.

On New Year's Eve 2024, nearly 1.3 million homes and businesses were left without electricity. In April 2025, another island-wide blackout shut down the grid again. The timeline keeps repeating. The only variable is who has generators, who has money, and who dies quietly at home.

The affluent have private infrastructure.  
The religious have prayers.  
The professionals have exhaustion.  
The cool people have opinions about other countries.
The welfare class has nothing resembling a buffer.

But the outages do not care which clique you belong to. Electricity does not respond to ideology. Dialysis machines do not care how you voted, or if you voted at all. Puerto Rico does not have a representation problem. It has a fragmentation problem. The system survives because each group explains the collapse in a way that preserves its own self-image. No one has to change if the failure can always be blamed somewhere else.

Change is still possible. The data already shows erosion in straight-ticket voting. New coalitions are forming. The old machine is weaker than it pretends to be. But none of that matters if people continue to confuse *identity with action*.

If the cliques remain intact, the infrastructure will keep failing, and people will keep dying in predictable, preventable ways. That is not a metaphor. It literally policy outcome.

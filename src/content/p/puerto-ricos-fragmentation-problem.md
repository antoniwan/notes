# Notes on Puerto Rico, Sin Pie Forzao'
## La Colonia Más Antigua

This is improvisation. Sin pie forzao', como los trovadores. It's the first time I write about Puerto Rico. The place I was born. Our beautiful island. The oldest colony in the modern world.

I acknowledge that I'm writing this from privilege. Parental leave with my newborn beside me. I heard Roy Brown's "Boricua en la Luna" and something inside me clicked. I needed to write about Puerto Rico.

Puerto Rico, for me, is the only toxic relationship you are permitted to have as a Boricua.

My parents live here. My ex-wife lives here. My 5-year-old daughter lives here. My partner's family lives here. My sister lives here. So when I talk about Puerto Rico, this isn't academic. I'm watching Puerto Rico's government and infrastructure grind the people I love in real time. I see criminality and gore left, right, and center. If you're reading this from the island, you probably know worse situations and cases than I do.

I graduated from Colegio San Antonio in Río Piedras. I went to the Universidad de Puerto Rico, Recinto de Río Piedras, but eventually after disillusionment after disillusion I left to work chasing the money bags. The American Dream. I got it actually, I made and got my own American dream, then lost it, then got it again, then lost it again. Most of us aren't that lucky. We boricua, we work hard and struggle hard.

> If something here tightens your stomach or pisses you off a little, good. That reaction is data. Trust it. I'm not asking you to agree with me. I'm asking you to *notice*.

## The Baseline

Puerto Rico's median household income is **$25,096**. The U.S.A. mainland sits at **$78,538**. This means that about **~43% of Puerto Rico residents live in poverty**, the highest rate of any U.S. jurisdiction. Mississippi, the poorest state, is under 20%.

Electricity costs **34 cents per kWh**. Mainland average is about **14 cents**. That's nearly **2.5× the price** for a grid that has collapsed repeatedly under private management (_Hey Luma!_).

Tolls increased again January 1st, 2026, with hikes across PR-22, PR-52, PR-5, PR-20, PR-53, PR-66 and the Puente Teodoro Moscoso (Metro Puerto Rico, 2026). Traveling round-trip on the José de Diego highway from San Juan to Hatillo now costs $13.60, up from $12.40 (Primera Hora, 2025).

The percent of debt to personal income is almost 90%—a ratio where anything above 50% indicates financial distress (Consolidated Credit, 2025). Six out of ten people who seek financial advisory services express feeling overwhelmed by debt. "People are no longer able to make ends meet, and they're using credit cards as part of their income to maintain certain levels of consumption" (Washington Journal Puerto Rico, 2025).

And healthcare isn't just becoming unaffordable—the doctors are leaving. Puerto Rico loses nearly **400 physicians annually** to the mainland, where family doctors earn an average of $237,000 compared to $194,307 on the island (JAMA Health Forum, 2024). Between 2010 and 2012, more than 4,000 health professionals—approximately 9% of the healthcare workforce—migrated to the U.S. mainland (Urban Institute, 2021). The ones who stay face longer wait times, reduced services, and the same exhaustion that keeps everyone else from engaging politically.

Education is following the same pattern. The Universidad de Puerto Rico, the island's only public university system and the source of 80% of all higher education R&D in Puerto Rico (Grupo CNE, 2021), has had its budget slashed by 47% since the Junta de Control Fiscal arrived (Rumbo Alterno, 2024). The Ley 2 de 1966 guaranteed UPR 9.6% of the general fund. That formula was frozen in 2015 under the PPD and gutted from 2017 under the PNP and the JCF (Momento Crítico, 2022). In a single cuatrienio, UPR lost $127 million in Department of Education contracts that shifted to private institutions (Diálogo UPR). Meanwhile, administrators of the Sistema Ana G. Méndez have publicly expressed interest in buying UPR campuses like Utuado, Aguadilla, and Ponce (Bandera, 2014). Former governor Pedro Rosselló worked for Ana G. Méndez while his son pushed online education privatization proposals that would funnel public students into private hands (Bandera, 2021). The system is a family dynasty—founded by Ana G. Méndez, passed to her son, now run by her grandson José F. Méndez Méndez, whose 2024 total compensation exceeded $1.35 million at a nonprofit institution running a $10.7 million deficit (ProPublica, 2024). You defund the public university, starve its contracts, then position the private one to absorb what's left. This is not neglect, this is literally the business plan, remember they want a Puerto Rico without puertorricans (needs reference!).

Those fancy cars you see? They're financed. Puerto Ricans carry **$1,300 more** in auto debt than mainland Americans on average, while earning **55% of mainland hourly wages**. The Tacoma isn't wealth. It's a seven-year loan at 84 months. The BMW isn't prosperity. It's the visible half of a debt-to-income ratio approaching 90%.

Are we the biggest spenders in the USA? No. But we might be the most leveraged ones. Private consumption accounts for **80% of Puerto Rico's GDP**, compared to ~68% on the mainland. We have the largest shopping mall in the Caribbean, 2.1 million square feet of retail, in a territory where 43% live in poverty and the median household income is $25,096.

Congressional testimony called it what it is: "high levels of private consumption and indebtedness enabled by having access to a stronger currency than its economic fundamentals would warrant." We consume at American standards on Puerto Rican wages, financed by American credit cards at 30% interest.

So yeah—jump on the Tacoma, post the beach pic, and let's talk archetypes.

## The Salaried Professionals

If you're a salaried professional in Puerto Rico, you are almost certainly underpaid to the point that political engagement becomes inherited instead of examined. The old **voto íntegro** system made this easy. In 2012, the PNP pulled 47% of its votes straight-ticket. The PPD got 46%. That's **93% of voters marking one X** under their family's color. Straight-ticket voting was the default for over 96% of voters.

Here's a concrete example from one of the hardest working women I've ever met: A Director of Sales at the largest cornmeal manufacturer on the island—a billion-dollar company, by the way—making **under $70k**. I have stories like this, professionals of all sorts, in all verticals, and it's mostly the same story.

Here's another: A public school teacher on the island made **$1,750 a month** as their base salary for **13 years straight**. No adjustments for inflation. No cost-of-living increases. The same $21,000 annual floor while electricity doubled and groceries climbed. It took 70% of teachers walking out in 2022 to force a temporary $1,000 monthly increase. Meanwhile, the U.S. mainland average teacher salary sits at **$72,030**. Even Mississippi, the lowest-paying state, averages $47,000.

Executive responsibility with entry-level mainland pay.

If you live here, you _know_ this isn't rare. You know _exactly_ who and what I'm talking about.

Y'all work 50+ hour weeks and commute through toll roads that cost $35–40 a month minimum. Then, again, pay double the mainland electricity rate.

By the time election season comes around, they're cooked because exhaustion isn't a side effect. It's the mechanism that ensures they mark one X. Go home. Keep the machine moving because they don't have the energy to fight the machine. Rajamos la papeleta! Yay!

By the way, about **22% of these households pay credit card late fees**. These aren't irresponsible people. These are professionals drowning inside a cost structure designed to bleed them slowly.

> I was one of these, but the colonized in me was too strong, so I left to chase money in the mainland.

## The Welfare Class

This group is exploited for votes and federal assistance dollars, often without full visibility into how the extraction works. The finesse in these matters, this is where our politicians spend all their energy, not on actual meaningful work, in PR (public relations) and the welfare class eats that shit up like sandwichitos de mezcla.

1.4 million people in Puerto Rico live below the federal poverty line. Almost one-in-five reports foregoing medical treatment because of cost (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2023).

**They live genuinely hard lives.** IMHO, these people live in HARD-MODE difficulty.

Consumer culture becomes the only accessible form of agency when you are surviving like this. Jordans. Cash for _verse cabrón_. A moment of dignity. I get it. The cruelty isn't how they spend. The cruelty is that consumption is the _only_ dignity the system offers while stripping healthcare, education, and mobility.

And no, our people aren't all housed either. In 2024, average home prices on the island increased by **15%**, with the typical home now costing **$221,824**. Puerto Rican families earn only **61% of the income needed to qualify for a mortgage** (Reason Foundation, 2025). Among extremely low-income renters, **86% experience severe cost burdens**, meaning they spend more than half their income just keeping a roof (National Low Income Housing Coalition, 2025). The official point-in-time count found **2,096 homeless individuals** in 2024 (San Juan Daily Star, 2024), but those numbers don't capture the families doubled up with relatives, the people sleeping in cars, or the post-María displaced who never came back. The real number is worse. It always is.

When the power goes out, these are the people who die first.

Seven years after María, Puerto Rico still doesn't have an integrated system to identify people who depend on electricity to survive.

> I'm not qualified to speak _for_ this group. My father grew up in poverty as an orphan in Santurce but I didn't. What I know is secondhand. What I _do_ know is that they are the most exploited and the most disposable when infrastructure fails. Their story deserves a first-person voice.

## The Affluent (Los Apellidos)

Inherited wealth, recognizable surnames, political dynasties. The families whose names appear on buildings, law firms, and campaign finance reports in the same breath. Many run for office. Many steal. Corruption in Puerto Rico isn't episodic—it's ambient. A steady parade of indictments across administrations confirms what everyone already knows (Refworld, 2012).

But this group doesn't just benefit from corruption. They architect it. They write the laws, fund the campaigns, and sit on the boards that award the contracts. Then when things collapse, they retreat behind generators, private water systems, and gated communities while the rest of the island sweats in the dark.

And then there are the _new_ apellidos. The ones nobody can pronounce because they just got here. Since 2012, over **6,000 wealthy investors** from the mainland have relocated to Puerto Rico under Act 60 (formerly Acts 20 and 22), lured by **0% capital gains tax** while keeping their U.S. citizenship (Borgen Magazine, 2025). They spent an estimated **$1.3 billion on real estate** between 2015 and 2019 (Catalyst Planet, 2025). Housing prices in San Juan jumped **22%** between 2018 and 2021. The median listing in San Juan hit **$905,000** in January 2024 (YIP Institute, 2024). In a territory where the median household income is $25,096.

Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz called it directly: "I don't think attracting tax avoiders is a good thing. Rather than bringing in revenue, they are raising the cost of living" (Latino Rebels, 2022). The Centro de Periodismo Investigativo found that the majority of Act 22 grantees "barely create jobs and represent minimal impact on the local economy" (Latino Rebels, 2022).

So the old money steals through politics and the new money steals through tax code. The result is the same: Puerto Ricans get displaced from their own island. Entire blocks in Condado and Old San Juan converted to Airbnbs. El Charco del Hippie, a swimming hole families used for generations near El Yunque, sold for $2.2 million to investors marketing it for short-term rentals. Vieques residents described it as a "tsunami of gentrification" at a United Nations decolonization hearing (Time, 2021).

They want a Puerto Rico without Puerto Ricans. The old apellidos vacation in Spain, send their kids to U.S. colleges, and invest in mainland real estate. The new ones arrive, buy beachfront, dodge taxes, and petition the local government to protect their investment while suing to block the modest donation requirements of their own tax decrees.

What kind of self-respect is that? For either group? IMHO, they don't respect the island. They respect money. They don't respect you or me.

Deep down, they know the whole thing is rotting. No amount of rum, cocaine, or club memberships fixes that.

---

## The Religious Bloc

The congregation that votes as instructed.

Proyecto Dignidad, for example, doesn't need a massive vote share to matter. They have something more efficient: **church networks**. The pastor points and the flock marks the ballot.

They vote against their own interests, then wonder why the hospitals don't work.

"These people are very well organized and have always had a profound political impact. The PNP and PPD right-wing politicians care a lot about the opinion of the religious sectors because they move many people, a lot of votes" (International Women's Media Foundation, n.d.).

After María, the most common causes of death weren't storm injuries. They were **cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney failure**—conditions that become lethal when care disappears.

People tithe money they don't have to churches that tell them how to vote for politicians who gut healthcare.

Then they pray. And then they die from preventable conditions. Pero ganamos...

## Los Más Cool (yo les digo Los Más Pendejos)

Young. Educated. Online.

Hyper-aware of Venezuela and Cuba—or at least they think they are. Extremely opinionated about Israel and Palestine. Deeply invested in U.S. politics, or at minimum deeply invested in having opinions about it. Many of them consume their politics the same way they consume Netflix: endlessly, passively, as background noise that produces the illusion of engagement.

But these people have never voted in a Puerto Rican election.

"They all suck." "It doesn't matter." "They're all corrupt." "What's the point?"

Here's the point. Puerto Rico's youth unemployment rate is **12.5%** (World Bank, 2024). The labor force participation rate on the island is **45%**, compared to **63% on the mainland** (Trading Economics, 2025). That means 6 out of every 10 working-age Puerto Ricans are not in the labor market. For ages 15–24, the participation rate drops to roughly **22%** (MacroTrends, 2023). Out of **150,000 young Boricuas** who reached voting age before the 2024 election, only **40,000—about 25%—had registered** (The Latino Newsletter, 2024).

These are the people who will inherit the debt, the blackouts, the toll hikes, and the hospital closures. They already live it. They pay the same 34 cents per kilowatt-hour. They sit through the same blackouts. They drive the same toll roads. They deal with the same unreliable healthcare system. None of that is abstract to them. It's their daily life.

And yet they have convinced themselves that non-participation is a form of protest rather than permission. Every election they skip is a vote for continuity. Not symbolically. Literally. Compliance without the dignity of knowing or admitting it.

Their abstention doesn't just cost them morally. It costs them economically. Every politician who wins on low turnout has zero incentive to address youth unemployment, student debt, or the brain drain that sends their friends to Orlando and Houston. The less they vote, the less they matter to the people writing the budgets. The math is simple and brutal.

## The Conscious Ones (Los Pelús)

The people who understand imperial law, historical patterns, colonial economics. Marginalized _precisely_ because their analysis threatens the bipartisan machinery. They build their own infrastructure out of necessity. These are the professors, philosophers, community leaders, los Tito Kayak, las Lola Rodriguez de Tió. These are our real leaders, the community.

They see everything clearly and can change almost nothing except their own environment, around them. Y cuidao', porque la policia no protege a la comunidad, protege el capital.

They're called communists, told to go to Venezuela, dismissed as idealists. They watch the same disasters repeat while their neighbors vote for the same two parties. They organize, they educate, they build solar microgrids and community health clinics, and they watch the elections get stolen anyway.

But if this essay is honest about every other group's blind spot, the pelús deserve the same honesty. The conscious class has a fragmentation problem of its own. They talk primarily to each other. The language of decolonization, while accurate, often lands as academic jargon to the salaried professional who just wants the lights to stay on. There's a tendency toward ideological purity that rejects imperfect coalition partners, and a fatigue that sometimes curdles into moral superiority: _I already know, I already did the work, you people refuse to see._ That posture may be earned, but it doesn't build the coalitions that actually win elections. Knowing the system is broken and making that knowledge accessible to 3 million people are two completely different skills. The pelús have mastered the first. The second is still in progress.

Still, there's movement. There's hope.

The straight-ticket vote dropped from 47%/46% in 2012 to 29%/25% by 2020 (Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, 2024a). The Alianza (PIP/MVC) explicitly rejects voto íntegro. In the 2024 general election, the Alianza secured second place with approximately 33% of the vote—a historic result (Grokipedia, 2025b). Voter turnout jumped from 55% in 2020 to nearly **65% in 2024** (IFES Election Guide, 2024).

The "corazón del rollo" is bleeding out. The question is whether the erosion translates to actual power transfer before the next 3,000 people die from infrastructure failure.

## The Body Count

Hurricane María killed roughly 3,000 people, not because of wind speed, but because the healthcare system collapsed and electricity stayed out for months. Six days after landfall, only 18 of 69 hospitals were functioning in any capacity. Every resident lost power. In rural municipalities, the blackout lasted more than half a year.

This did not end with María.

On New Year's Eve 2024, nearly 1.3 million homes and businesses were left without electricity. In April 2025, another island-wide blackout shut down the grid again. The timeline keeps repeating. The only variable is who has generators, who has money, and who dies quietly at home.

The affluent have private infrastructure. The religious have prayers. The professionals have exhaustion. The cool people have opinions about other countries. The welfare class has nothing resembling a buffer.

But the outages do not care which clique you belong to. Electricity does not respond to ideology. Dialysis machines do not care how you voted, or if you voted at all. Puerto Rico does not have a representation problem. It has a fragmentation problem. The system survives because each group explains the collapse in a way that preserves its own self-image. No one has to change if the failure can always be blamed somewhere else.

Change is still possible. The data already shows erosion in straight-ticket voting. New coalitions are forming. The old machine is weaker than it pretends to be. But none of that matters if people continue to confuse identity with action.

If the cliques remain intact, the infrastructure will keep failing, and people will keep dying in predictable, preventable ways. That is not a metaphor. It is literally a policy outcome.

## What Comes Next

And here's the thing: this is only what I know about. This is only what made it into the news, what the investigative journalists uncovered, what my family and friends on the island tell me when we talk. This is the visible layer.

In December 2025, Governor González Colón signed Act 156, a law restricting public access to government documents. The new legislation doubles the time agencies have to respond to information requests, allows the government to classify information as confidential without judicial review, and eliminates privacy protections for people who request records (Associated Press, 2025; Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, 2025c). The same government that failed to track who depends on electricity to survive now gets to decide what you're allowed to know about how it operates.

I have no idea what's coming next for our island. None of us do. That's the point.

I told you at the top: if something here tightened your stomach, that reaction is data.

Now what are you going to do with it?

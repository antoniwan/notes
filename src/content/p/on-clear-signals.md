This morning with a full house, kids running around, dogs being their honest mammal selves, Z doing Z things, all the usual chaos that makes the day feel like a day — I'm cooking, regulating one kid while answering the other, side-eyeing the dogs as they speak in posture and breath, thinking about my estranged 20-year-old stepson and his permanent silence… and suddenly something clicks.

### **"Everything alive in this house gives me clean signals."**

I've curated my environment — almost unknowingly — by setting up boundaries that protect my becoming. I’ve built a life around beings and contexts that give me clean signal. It’s the effortful thing to do, no?

If you don't know what a clean signal is:

To me, a clean signal is any communication — words, gestures, sounds, movement, touch, whatever — that connects the person sending it and the person receiving it, and both bodies go, "Yeah, I get you." That’s it. No decoding. No translating. No acting.

- The 2-year-old is instinct incarnate. Pure raw signal.
- My 5-year-old is sincerity with legs. Chaotic but real AF. When safe. When she doesn’t feel safe, she closes up — clean and consistent.
- The dogs? Walking truth. Breath, weight, micro-movements. No stories, no spinning. Just organism-to-organism honesty. If there’s food, there are no passions or factions or sides — just dominance hierarchies like nature intended.
- My girlfriend and I work on our communication weekly because we know this is what will make our busy lives actually function.

Nothing here strategizes around me or performs for me or talks to “the role” I used to play (as if we were objects frozen in time… wild). Everything meets me directly. Because their signals are clean, mine stay clean too. My attention lands without friction. My patience stretches without effort. My presence sharpens without me trying.

And I realized: I’m not becoming healthier only because I’m working on myself (I am, but that’s not the point). I’m becoming healthier because the environment is honest enough that my real nature shows up without armor.

There’s a loop, simple and undeniable:

#### **clean signal → clean response → real connection**

And now I see how far that loop has spread. Dating felt off because the signals were muddy. Friendships collapsed because the signals contradicted themselves. I’ve walked away from jobs, partnerships, invitations — not out of drama, but out of clarity. Ambiguity now feels like laziness. Like disrespect. Like background radiation my nervous system refuses to tolerate.

It’s not even conscious. It’s reflex. My body rejects ambiguity before a single thought forms. Maybe that’s bias, maybe that’s trauma, maybe that’s wisdom. I’m still figuring it out. But patterns don’t lie: clean signals hit the body different. They land well. They have “that energy.”

So then I thought about adults:

- Many adults speak in half-signals.
- … cling to old versions of you.
- … project their shit and call it connection.
- … talk around the truth instead of through it. Peacekeeping? Cowardice? Who knows.
- … want access, not presence.

Or maybe this only applies to the adults I have access to. Or maybe it’s universal to unhealed adults. I don’t know.

I *do* know that once you start respecting yourself, you lose the ability to translate for people. Something in the body says no — before logic, before empathy scripts, before the “be understanding” scaffolding boots up.

There is something beautiful about no longer shrinking or pretending or offering or bending. You stop negotiating with silence. You stop offering clarity to people who treat clarity like confrontation. You stop bending your emotional availability around someone else’s inability to show up.

It’s energy conservation.

Most unclear relationships don’t explode.  
They just… evaporate. Quiet.

No betrayals, no villain arcs. Just the slow collapse of something that only survived because you kept performing. Once you stop performing, the truth arrives. Like my main phone number. Call forward broken for four months. Never noticed.

I only realized because a cousin confronted me. I apologized, explained, gave him the correct number. He never used it. Judgment? Curiosity? Gossip? No fucking clue. Still love you, primo.

And I don’t actually care. My body already filed it under “unclear.” That’s enough for me now.

Ambiguity is expensive. Confusion costs energy to decipher. Muddy signals drain the exact parts of me I’ve spent years rebuilding.

So that dead phone number? Maybe not an accident. Maybe not a glitch. Maybe a metaphor with teeth.

Because what I ultimately learned is this:

People who want to reach you will reach you.  
A pretty clear signal.

Clean signals aren’t a luxury anymore.  
They’re the minimum requirement for belonging in my life.

I invite you to use clear signals as your shield — and get cooking in your own life too.

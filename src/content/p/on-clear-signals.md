This morning with a full house, kids running around, dogs being their honest mammal selves, Z doing Z things, all the usual chaos that makes the day feel like a day — I'm cooking, regulating one kid while answering the other, side-eyeing the dogs as they speak in posture and breath, thinking about my estranged 20-year-old stepson and his permanent silence… and suddenly something clicks.

### **"Everything alive in this house gives me clean signals."**

I've curated my environment, almost unknowingly by setting up boundaries for myself and my belonging and becoming, around only beings and contexts that give me clean signal. It's the effortful thing to do, no?

If you don't know what a clean signal is:

To me, a clean signal is any communication — words, gestures, sounds, movement, touch, whatever — that connects the person sending it and the person receiving it, and both bodies go, "Yeah, I get you." That's it. No decoding. No translating. No acting.

- The 2-year-old is instinct incarnate. Pure raw signal.
- My 5-year-old is sincerity with legs, chaotic but real AF. When safe. When she doesn't feel safe, she doesn't open up, clear and consistent.
- The dogs? Walking truth. Breath, weight, micro-movements. No stories, no spinning. Just organism-to-organism honesty. If there's food, there are no passions or factions or sides, it's about physical dominance.
- My girlfriend and I work on our communication weekly, because we know this will make our busy lives work together, before anything else will

Nothing here, nobody strategizes around me or performs for me or talks to "the role" I used to play (as if we people were objects frozen in time... wild!). We communicate in clear signals, our ideas don't have to ever meet, but we give it our best to understand and send clear signals. Our bodies can feel this, it's instinct. The environment I'm keeping around meets me directly. And because its signals are clean, mine are clean too. It's really nice. My attention, our attention, mostly lands without friction, and my patience stretches without effort, and my presence sharpens without me trying.

And I realized I'm not becoming healthier because I'm working on myself (I am, but that's not the point). I'm becoming healthier because the environment is honest enough that my real nature shows up without needing armor.

There's a loop, and my body keeps proving it:

#### **clean signal → clean response → real connection**

And now I see how far that loop has spread. How much it's shaped my decisions without me noticing. Dating felt off because the signals were muddy. Friendships collapsed because the signals contradicted themselves. I've walked away from jobs, partnerships, invitations not out of drama, but out of clarity. Ambiguity now feels like laziness. Like disrespect. Like background radiation my nervous system refuses to tolerate. Like unwanted noise.

By the way, it's not even me-me rejecting ambiguity, my body just cringes automatically without having to produce a single concious or intentional thought. It's practiced reflex? This is something I'm still working on because personal bias is real, and I'm not infallible. But the patterns are there, clean and clear signals feel straight to the body, they land well, they have "that energy" we enjoy. "I like their energy" vibe.


And then I thought about adults:

	•	Many adults speak in half-signals.
	•	... cling to old versions of you.
	•	... project their shit and call it connection.
	•	... talk around the truth instead of through it. Peacekeeping? Cowardice? Who knows.
	•	... want access, not presence.

Or hey, maybe this only applies to the adults I have access to. Or maybe it applies to any and all unhealed adults. I don't know.
I do know that once you start respecting yourself, you literally lose the ability to translate for people. Something in the body says no, and that no comes before the thought. Before the logic. Before the “I should use empathy” scaffolding kick in.

There's something beautiful when you stop shrinking or pretending or negotiating or offering or bending. You stop negotiating with silence. You stop offering clarity to people who treat clarity like confrontation. You stop bending your emotional availability around someone else’s inability to show up. When you think about it, this is all about energy conservation.

In my experience, most unclear relationships don't explode.

They just… evaporate. Quiet.

There are no big announced betrayals or villain arcs. Just the quiet collapse of something that only survived because you kept performing Once you stop performing, the truth arrives. Like my main phone number's forward that I didn't realize was wrong for months; I only realized because a cousing confronted me about it, I replied, apologized, realized, thanked him. Gave him a new phone number to reach me.

He never used it.

So… why ask?

Judgment? Curiosity? Gossip?

No fucking clue. I still love you primo.

It' ok I don't actually care because my body already filed it under "unclear." That's enough for me now to not direct much energy towards this type of ambiguity.

I think ambiguity is expensive because confusion costs energy to decipher or try to understand. Muddy signals drain the exact parts of me I’ve spent years literally rebuilding with emotional scaffolding.

So that dead phone number? Perhaps it was not an accident or a glitch or a dumb ass mistake (it was, it is, i still haven't fixed it) but a metaphor with teeth.

Because what I ultimately learned is that people who want to reach you will reach you, a pretty clear signal. Clear signals are beautiful. Clean signals aren’t a luxury anymore. They’re the minimum requirement for belonging in my life. I invite you to use clear signals are your shield and get cooking in your life too.

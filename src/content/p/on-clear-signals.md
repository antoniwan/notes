Some months ago I did something stupid, or maybe it was perfect. I got myself a couple of commercial phone numbers for the new brand identity I'm building — freelancing, retailing, a little ecosystem of work that finally feels like me — and I tried to set up call-forwarding from my personal number. I've had that number forever. The whole point was to pay for redirection so I didn't have to carry two phones. Easy.

Except it never worked. For months. And I didn't notice. Not once. My "main" number (the one tied to my entire life history) was basically unplugged for four straight months (still is). And the only reason I found out wasn't because someone checked in, worried, missed me, insisted on hearing my voice. It was because one blood relative confronted me about it.

No one else reached out.
No friend.
No "close" people.
Nobody.
*Maybe just Matias. Mati is always Mati. I love you, Mati.*

So the truth was simple: my number died, and the world didn't blink.

I sat with that for days. Not dramatically — more like I let the data assemble itself. Let my ego metabolize whatever this was without forcing a narrative.

✨

Fast-forward to this morning, another day in a full house: kids running around, dogs being honest mammals, Z moving through her rituals, the constant flow of noise and motion that makes a day feel like a day. I'm cooking, regulating one kid while responding to the other, side-eyeing the dogs as they speak in posture and breath, thinking about my estranged 20-year-old stepson's silence… and suddenly the pattern hits me clean:

### *"Everything alive in this house gives me clean signals."*

I've curated my environment, almost unknowingly by setting up boundaries for myself and my belonging and becoming, around only beings and contexts that give me clean signal. It's the effortful thing to do, no?

By the way, if you have no fucking clue what is a *clean signal*: To me, a clean signal is any communication, verbal or non-verbal (actions, movement, sound, touch, gift, etcetera) that connects both the person who communicates and whoever receives the message and the message is understood by those involved. 


- The 2-year-old I'm meeting as part of my new relationships is instinct in its purest form: raw, unfiltered, direct.
- My 5-year-old is sincerity-in-motion, chaotic but real AF
- The dogs are walking honesty: breath, weight, micro-movements, all signal, no story. We can learn much from the reaction of blindly loyal organisms.

Nothing here, nobody strategizes around me or performs for me or talks to "the role" I used to play (as if we people were objects frozen in time... wild!). Our bodies can feel this, it's instinct.

The people and environment I'm keeping around meets me directly. And because its signal is clean, mine is clean. My attention lands without friction, and my patience stretches without effort, and my presence sharpens without me trying.

So yeah, I'm becoming an integrated version of myself that doesn't need armor and not because I'm "working on myself," but because the environment is honest enough to pull the real nature out of me.

There's a biological loop here:

#### **clean signal → clean response → real connection**

And now I see how far that loop has spread. How much it's shaped my decisions without me noticing. Dating felt off because the signals were muddy. Friendships collapsed because the signals contradicted themselves. I've walked away from jobs, partnerships, invitations not out of drama, but out of clarity. Ambiguity now feels like laziness. Like disrespect. Like background radiation my nervous system refuses to tolerate. Like unwanted noise.

By the way, it's not even me-me rejecting ambiguity, my body just cringes automatically without having to produce a single concious or intentional thought. It's practiced reflex? This is something I'm still working on because personal bias is real, and I'm not infallible. But the patterns are there, clean and clear signals feel straight to the body, they land well, they have "that energy" we enjoy. "I like their energy" vibe.

Let's see if this lands with you. I think once you've lived with clean signals long enough, adult communication becomes almost unreadable:

- Adults speak in half-signals...
- Adults cling to outdated versions of you
- Adults project unto you
- Adults talk around the truth instead of through it... peace-keeping? cowardice? i don't know which is worse.
- Adults want access, not presence.
- Adults want the version of you that made their life easier, even if he died years ago.

Or hey, maybe this only applies to the adults I have access to. Or maybe it applies to any and all unhealed adults.

And here’s the part that surprised me the most: once you start respecting yourself, you literally lose the ability to translate for people. Something in the body says no, and that no comes before the thought. Before the logic. Before the “I should use empathy” scaffolding kick in.

There's something beautiful when you stop shrinking or pretending or negotiating or offering or bending. You stop negotiating with silence. You stop offering clarity to people who treat clarity like confrontation. You stop bending your emotional availability around someone else’s inability to show up. When you think about it, this is all about energy conversation.

I observe that many of these relationships that exist without a clear sygnals (communication) don’t explode. They just… evaporate without betrayal, dramatic exits, villain arcs. Nothing dude. They just dissapear. Just a quiet collapse of something that clearly depended on you performing the role for it to exist at all. Once you stop playing the role, or roles assigned to you by others, the connection reveals itself as a habit perhaps, or the reciprocity or lack of it becomes too obvious and loud, that familiar pattern two humans kept repeating without noticing the meaning had died years ago and you can't run away from it anymore.

Take my cousin — the one who “confronted” me about the dead number.
I replied. Gave him my new number. He never used it so I beg to wonder why he asked me about it... what was the veredict, the judgement, the idea. Why I did why or the what or... wait... I don't really care because I don't fuck with unclear comunication anymore. This is the gift i'm trying to give you.

**Clean signal → connection**
**Murky signal → exhaustion**

I think ambiguity is expensive because confusion costs energy to decipher or try to understand. Muddy signals drain the exact parts of me I’ve spent years literally rebuilding with emotional scaffolding.

So that dead phone number? Perhaps it was not an accident or a glitch or a dumb ass mistake (it was, it is, i still haven't fixed it) but a metaphor with teeth.

Because what I ultimately learned is that people who want to reach you will reach you, a pretty clear signal. Clear signals are beautiful. Clean signals aren’t a luxury anymore. They’re the minimum requirement for belonging in my life.
Period.

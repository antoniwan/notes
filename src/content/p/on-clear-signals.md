Some months ago I did something stupid, or maybe it was perfect. I got myself a couple of commercial phone numbers for the new brand identity I'm building — freelancing, retailing, a little ecosystem of work that finally feels like me — and I tried to set up call-forwarding from my personal number. I've had that number forever. The whole point was to pay for redirection so I didn't have to carry two phones. Easy.

Except it never worked. For months. And I didn't notice. Not once. My "main" number — the one tied to my entire life history — was basically unplugged for four straight months (still is). And the only reason I found out wasn't because someone checked in, worried, missed me, insisted on hearing my voice. It was because **one** blood relative confronted me about it.

No one else reached out.  

No friend. 

No "close" people.  

Nobody.

*Maybe just Matias. Mati is always Mati. I love you, Mati.*

So the truth was simple: my number died, and the world didn't blink.

I sat with that for days. Not dramatically — more like I was letting the data arrange itself. Letting my ego metabolize whatever this was without forcing a narrative.

Fast-forward to today, another morning in a full house: kids running around, dogs being honest mammals, Z moving through her rituals, the constant flow of noise and movement that makes a day feel like a day. I'm cooking, regulating one kid while responding to the other, side-eyeing the dogs as they communicate in posture and breath, thinking about my estranged 20-year-old stepson's silence… and suddenly the pattern hits me in the chest.

**Everything alive in this house gives me clean signals.** I've carefully made sure to keep close, only, people, animals, and environments that give me clean clear signals! It's the effortful thing to do, no?!

That's the whole thing.

That's the shift I hadn't named.

The 2-year-old is instinct in its purest form — raw, unfiltered, fast, direct.

My 5-year-old is sincerity-in-motion, chaotic but real. She doesn't know how to pretend. She tells the truth even when she doesn't have the vocabulary for it.

The dogs are walking honesty. They communicate through weight distribution, breath, attention, micro-movements. No performance. No stories. No outdated versions of me projected onto my face.

Nothing here strategizes around me.  

Nothing performs for me.  

Nothing talks to "the role" I used to play.

They meet me directly.  

And because their signal is clean, mine becomes clean.

My attention lands without friction.  

My patience stretches without effort.  

My presence sharpens without me trying.

I become the version of myself that doesn't need armor — not because I'm "working on myself," but because this environment is honest enough to pull my real nature forward.

There's a biological loop here:

**clean signal → clean response → real connection**

And today I realized how far this loop has spread into my life. How much it has shaped my decisions *without me noticing*. Dating felt off because the signals were muddy. Friendships collapsed because the signals contradicted themselves. I've walked away from jobs, partnerships, invitations — not out of drama, but because the signals were unclear. Ambiguity now feels like laziness. Like disrespect. Like background radiation my nervous system refuses to tolerate.

Once you've lived with clean signals long enough, adult communication becomes almost unreadable.

Adults speak in half-signals.  

Adults cling to outdated versions of you.  

Adults talk around the truth instead of through it.  

Adults want access, not presence.  

Adults want the version of you that made their life easier, even if he died years ago.

Or perhaps this only applies to the adults *I have access to...* Or perhaps this applies to any and all *unhealed adult*...

And when you start respecting yourself — quietly, internally — something in you refuses to translate anymore.

You stop shrinking yourself to remain legible to their nostalgia, decoding sentences that weren't meant to be understood, bending your emotional availability around somebody else's absence and simply **most adults just fade out with this clarity...** 

Not with a fight.  

Not with betrayal.  

Just… dissolution.

When you stop performing the role, the entire relationship collapses. Because it was never a relationship — it was a habit. Perhaps only a role, some faint tradition, this is just the way things have been like. I say, fuck no, the signals are extra clear.

Take my cousin's one example. He "confronted" me about the dead number.  

I told him, "No, the number just stopped working. Thanks for letting me know."  

He never replied again.

Another unclear signal.  

Another nothing.  

And that's exactly what it was: nothing.

The silence didn't hurt.  

It just clarified!

And meanwhile, the living beings in my orbit keep showing up with their honesty... dead simple honesty, really...

A toddler tugging at my attention without a single ulterior motive.  

A 5-year-old who softens the moment I soften.  

A 20-year-old piecing adulthood together through proximity.  

Dogs who co-regulate with me faster than most adults regulate themselves.  

A partner who, when she's present, speaks with a directness that feels like home.  

And myself — finally reachable. By me.

So yeah, here's where it all landed for me:

**Once you're surrounded by clean signals, you understand how expensive murky ones actually are.**

A relationship that requires translation is not only a relationship — it's freaking labor.  

A relationship that requires an internal interpreter trains you to distrust yourself!!!

A relationship that depends on you wearing an old costume is not alive!!!!

Once you taste clarity — real clarity — you stop apologizing for needing it.

The number being dead for four months wasn't a mistake.  

It was a metaphor.

**People who want to be in your life will find you.**  

**People who don't will vanish the moment the convenience disappears.**

Not personal.  

Just physics.

Clean signal → connection.  

Murky signal → absence.

And when you stop covering the absence with effort, the absence stays empty.

So yeah... a life where people meet you as you are, not as a role, isn't a preference. Clear signals are now a minimum requirement for my relationships.

My daughter asks me the same question several times a day: "Papi, how much longer until you're done with work?"

It's a sweet question. She's counting down to when she gets my full attention.

There's nothing wrong with it but every time she asks, a crash cymbal goes off in my head. I swear my context goes kaput and the switching is so expensive I don't know I will recover from it, even if it takes me less than a minute to respond.

Not anger at her. Something else. The cymbal is the sound of friction, the cost of producing an answer to a simple question.

Here's what actually happens when she asks:

I stop whatever I'm doing. Mid-sentence on a call. Mid-thought on a problem. Mid-stirring something on the stove. I register the question. I look for a clock. I check the time. I remember when I'm supposed to be done. I do subtraction. I translate the result into something a five-year-old understands. Is "one hour" better or "a long time still"? I deliver the answer. I try to find where I was. I fail partially.

All of that for a number she'll ask for again in twenty minutes.

The annoyance isn't at Mia. It's at the cascade. The machinery I have to spin up to produce a two-second answer. And I don't want that machinery anywhere near her. I don't want the cymbal crash leaking into my voice when I answer. She's asking with love. I want to answer with love. Clean, no static.

So I built a clock. It counts down to the end of my workday. She asks, I glance, I answer. No subtraction. No hunting for the time. No translation. The cymbal doesn't hit because there's nothing to hit against.

It's a small tool. Ugly, even. It solves exactly one problem that only exists in my specific life.

But here's what I'm noticing: most friction looks like a patience problem when it's actually a design problem.

I could have told myself to be less irritated. To breathe through it. To remember she's five and she loves me and this is a privilege. All true. But that's treating the symptom. The cause was a fifteen-second process disguised as a two-second interaction. Remove the process, the irritation disappears on its own.

Parenting is full of these. Small repeated costs that feel like character failures. You think you need more patience. Maybe you need a different system. You think your kid is being difficult. Maybe the friction is in the request, not the child.

Resentment builds from accumulation. Tiny taxes, paid over and over, compounding into something that looks like a relationship problem but started as a design problem. A question that costs too much to answer. A transition that triggers resistance because of how it's framed. A recurring negotiation that could have been a clear boundary.

The clock didn't make me a better father. It removed something that was making me a worse one, one small crash at a time.

She still asks. I still answer. But now when I say "forty-five minutes, mija," there's nothing in my voice but the truth and the warmth underneath it.

That's all she was asking for anyway.
